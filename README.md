## ‚öôÔ∏è Plugin settings

In order for the plugin to work properly, it needs the right credentials to authenticate with Chartbrew.

The plugin can also create charts straight from Strapi, but this needs access to Strapi through an API token.

Follow the instructions below to learn how to configure the plugin.

### Chartbrew connection

If you self-host Chartbrew, you will have to enter the frontend and backend addresses. The default values are:

* Frontend: `http://localhost:4018`
* Backend: `http://localhost:4019`

If you want to use the plugin with a managed service account at [chartbrew.com](https://chartbrew.com), click on the **Use managed Chartbrew address** button as shown below:
